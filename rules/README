Target specific include makefiles.
The include makefiles contain instructions on what toolchain and options to use.
What precompiled/proprietary libs to link with.
What components to build and include into the target package.
Where/how to install the components for the specifc target (i.e. install into
appropriate paths as the components have to be in the target filesystem).
