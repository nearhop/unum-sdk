This folder contains agent components sources.
Each component is located under its own folder.
Each component is expected to be a standalone module that 
is compiled into an executable or library. 
The build system will go into all the folders listed in the 
build rules/<model>.mk file for specific model and invoke make 
with the necessary generic compiler options.

If the component requires customization for the specifc 
platform the custom options can be listed for that platform 
in the platform rules/<model>.mk file.

Buy default the sytem goes into the component folder and runs 
make there only if the Makefiles or anything under the component's 
folder changes. Use symlinks (under your component folder) pointing 
to other components to access includes and/or make your component 
depend on the others.
